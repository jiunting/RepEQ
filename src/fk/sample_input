# Notes about some parameters (the values in parenthesis are preferred):
#
# src_layer	The layer where the source is located on the top.
#
# src_type	0=explosion, 1=single force, 2=double couple.
#
# receiver_lay	The layer where receivers are located on the top.
#
# updn		1 = down-going wave only; -1 = up-going wave only; 0=whole.
# 
# sigma		in 1/trace_length, the small imaginary frequency (2-3).
# 
# nt	The number of points in the time domain, must be 2**N with N>=0.
#	nt=1 will compute static disp. using static Haskell matrices.
# 	nt=2 will compute static disp. using dynamic Haskell matrices at 0 freq.
#	In this case, a large dt (e.g., 1000) should be used so that 1/dt = 0.
# 
# dt	in sec, sampling interval (see the smooth factor below).
# 
# taper	The tapering factor to suppress high frequencies (0-1, 0=off).
# 
# nb	Number of points to be saved before t0 (10-50).
# 
# smt	integer of 2**N, a smooth factor to increase the sampling rate
#	of the output time sequence. The final output will be smt*nt
#	points with a sampling interval of dt/smt.
# 
# wc1 wc2	Two integers that define a high-pass filter:
# 		 0 for f < (wc1-1)*df,
# 	  H(f) = cosine (wc1-1)*df <= f <= (wc2-1)*df
# 		 1 for f > (wc2-1)*df
# 
# pmin pmax	in 1/Vs_at_source, minimum and maximum slowness.
# 	[w*pmin, w*pmax] specifies the window for the
#	the wavenumber integration (default: pmin=0; pmax=1-1.5).
# 
# dk	in pi/max(Xmax, source_depth), wavenumber sampling interval (0.2-0.5).
# 
# kmax	in 1/source_depth, the maximum wavenumber at zero frequency (10-30).
# 
# The output is the surface displacement (in SAC format for the dynamic case and
# ASCII file for the static case), in the order of vertical (UP), radial,
# and tangential (counterclockwise) for n=0, 1, 2 (i.e. Z0, R0, T0, Z1, ...).
# Their units are (assume v in km/s, rho in g/cm^3, thickness in km):
#        10^-20 cm/(dyne cm)     for double couple source and explosion;
#        10^-15 cm/dyne          for single force.
# For the dynamic case, the source time function is assumed to be a Dirac delta.
# So the outputs actually correspond to velocities from a step function source.
